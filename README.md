A ray tracer for fractals

# About
This is a ray tracer that was written for CS500 at digipen institute. The original framework was developed by Garry Herron.

# Controls

SHIFT-ESC: exits the program after writing the last render

QWEASD: controls the camera position

UIOJKL: controls the camera rotation

P: toggles FOV effect

Y: re-loads scene file

# Notes
If there the output from the last run exists, it will be backed up under a timestamped name.

Re-loading the level will not reset the camera's position.

If you would like to permanently change the camera's position, its new parameters are printed to the command line after every move.
